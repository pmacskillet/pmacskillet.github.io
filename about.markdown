Hello and welcome to my blog, Parallels, where I hope to provide quality travel guides to the places I've been. While the word "parallels" refers to the lines of latitude banding the Earth, it can also be used to describe things that are similar, but slightly different. Throughout my travels these are the things that always piqued my interest, as I find it fascinating how different regions and countries add their own unique twist to global ideas. This includes things like airlines, beer, and fast food chains.  

I'm aiming to keep each post short and sweet, highlighting the "must-do's" and top eats so you can get the gist, then craft your own experience. While travelling, I tend to go with more budget friendly accommodation/transportation options while splurging on the things like food and experiences, so reviews will reflect that. I hope you enjoy my accounts of experiences around the world, and find my tips useful :)  
  
Happy traveling, 

-Paolo
