# Maui Adventure

<img src="/images/maui-map.png" class="img-fluid" alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maui_region_map_EN.png">

## <ins>TL;DR<ins>

### General Info
- You absolutely need to rent a car because a lot of the island is remote. You can still Uber/Lyft within populated areas.
- We spent 12 days in Maui and covered all corners of the island.
- Maui is pretty expensive so we mixed some camping with Air BnBs.

### Top Things You Need to Do
- Watch the sunrise atop [Mt. Haleakela](https://www.nps.gov/hale/planyourvisit/sunrise-and-sunset.htm). You must sign up in advance. It gets literally freezing cold, so bring a jacket and pants.
- Drive the [Road to Hana](https://roadtohana.com/). Drive the full round trip from Kahului along the north and south ends of the island, stopping at any point that interests you along the way.
- Camp at [Waiʻānapanapa State Park](https://www.google.com/search?q=wainapana+state+park&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&oq=wainapana+state+park&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.5449j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and swim in the black sand beaches.
- Hike the [Pipiwai Trail](https://www.google.com/search?q=pipiwai+trail&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&oq=pip&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2j46l2j0l3.2742j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8): Beautiful waterfalls and bamboo forests
- Take an [OPEN BAR SUNSET SAIL](https://teralani.net/Maui-Sunset-Sail/original.htm) from Kaanapali.
- Spend some time in the town of [Lahaina](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tDP1TcoNsgqNmD0Ys9JzEjMzEsEADcaBd4&q=lahaina&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&oq=Lah&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46j0l2j46j0l2.3265j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Visit [Maui Brewing Co.](https://www.mbcrestaurants.com/lahaina/) and [Koholā Brewery](https://www.koholabrewery.com/).
- Scuba dive: I went near Kihei, it was ok. If you can afford it try diving the [Lanai Cathedrals](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&sxsrf=ALeKk03Y48I7WcvFCsdn48Qhfu3UZm5x7w%3A1589685181845&ei=vavAXv6VM830tAaprbboDA&q=lanai+cathedrals&oq=lanai+cath&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgIIADIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgQIIxAnOgUIABCRAjoFCAAQgwE6BwgAEBQQhwJQtxpYqCxg-DVoAHAAeACAAdoHiAGkEZIBCTcuMS41LTEuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab).

## Guide

I took this trip in October 2019 with my girlfriend. When we travel we like to do as many things as possible, so we had a condensed schedule. We also try to budget accommodations most of the time and splurge in experiences and food. 

If you're flying in from the mainland, you'll probably land in Kahului. This is the biggest town on the island but there isn't much to see here. There are good restaurants (see Da Kitchen and Tin Roof above) and bars to check out but that's mostly it. I suggest spending your time here stocking up on food and supplies because it has the largest selection of stores. You can rent your car and camping gear here as well. We rented from [Manaloha Car Rental](https://www.manaloharentacar.net/) because they offer older cars at a lower price that you can pick up and drop off at the airport. Be careful with this though, as our car broke down in Hana, which is very remote. They did send us a new car, but it took an entire day. After talking with the manager they were kind enough to refund us one day of the rental. We rented our camping gear from [Maui Vacation Equipment](https://www.mauivacationequipment.com/). This place is awesome because they can deliver the equipment anywhere on the island for free as long as your order is above a certain cost. We had them deliver our equipment straight to our hostel in Paia the day we started the road to Hana. When you're done with your equipment you can just drop it off at a locker near the Kahului airport.

We wanted to hit all parts corners of the island and we started with the west side. The areas around Lahaina and Kaanapali have a lot of resorts if that's your thing but we settled for an Air BnB. There's really only one way to get there from Kahalui, and that's via the Honoapiilani Highway along the island's south coast. There is a northern route via the Kahekili Highway but it is pretty scary if you're not the best driver or not a local. It features a lot of tight, one-lane stretches along cliffs. Unfortunately, when we arrived there was a huge fire around the Honoapiilani Highway so a 45 minute drive from Kahalui to Laina turned into hours. There isn't much you can do to mitigate against this risk if you're staying on the west side, but there is a smaller airport in Kapalua that you can fly straight into from Honolulu. 

We stayed in the medium sized (for Maui) coastal town of Lahaina. It features a walkable downtown area filled with little shops, art galleries, bars, and the largest Banyan tree in the United States. While it's not party central, it's a nice relaxing place to set up base for exploring the west side of the island as you can hit up the restaurants, bars, and breweries when you return from your day trips. Speaking of breweries, check out both [Maui Brewing Co.](https://www.mbcrestaurants.com/lahaina/) and [Koholā Brewery](https://www.koholabrewery.com/) for great local brews. Be aware that in the peak season for tourism (December-April) this town can get quite busy.

        There are some great places to swim on the west side that (from my experience in October) aren't crowded at all. For that picturesque, white sand Hawaiian staple, check out <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&sxsrf=ALeKk01K62iuTYqhJa3DNDngwCpAn335bg%3A1589684752911&ei=EKrAXtv_NsO5tQa245O4Bg&q=slaughterhouse+beach&oq=sl&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgQIIxAnMgQIIxAnMgUIABCRAjIECAAQQzIECAAQQzIECAAQQzIHCAAQgwEQQzIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAOgUIABCDAVDKvQFYzr4BYOHKAWgAcAB4AIABuAGIAeUCkgEDMC4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab">Slaughterhouse Beach</a>. If you're also into snorkeling head just around the bend from Slaughterhouse to (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=honolua+bay&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS878US878&oq=Honolua+Bay&aqs=chrome.0.0j46j0l6.314j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Honolua Bay</a> for a lively reef that's easily accessible from shore.

        Since you're on the west end, this is the perfect opportunity to watch the sunset. There is a beautiful point that's accessible via a dirt road at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@21.0169461,-156.6397424,17z">these coordinates</a>. We also car camped here for one night, and it was a awesome experience. The picture banner on top of this page is from that point. Another great way to watch the sunset is to book an <a href="https://teralani.net/Maui-Sunset-Sail/original.htm">open bar sunset cruise</a> from Kaanapali. They can get quite pricey, but this is one of the things we wanted to splurge on and it was worth every penny. It was a blast, beautiful, and if you know how to handle your drinking, can be quite economical.
