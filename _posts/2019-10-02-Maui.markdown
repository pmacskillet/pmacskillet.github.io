# Maui Adventure

![Map of Maui](/images/Maui_region_map_EN.png =400x)

## TL;DR
 - General Info
   - We spent 2 weeks in Maui and covered all corners of the island.
   - Maui is pretty expensive so we mixed some camping with Air BnBs.
   - You absolutely need to rent a car because a lot of the island is remote. You can still Uber/Lyft within populated areas.
 
   
## Full Guide
 - North Maui
   - You'll probably fly into Kahului. It's the biggest city on the island but there's not much to do here besides eat and stock up on food/supplies.
     - I reccommend eating at [Da Kitchen]("https://dakitchen.com/"). It has delicious local dishes with huge servings at a great price. It was also featured on "Diners Drive-Ins and Dives".
     - If you're going to camp rent your gear here.
